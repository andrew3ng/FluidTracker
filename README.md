# FluidTracker

This project is completely separate from Tambre's by accident, but I was able to get expo working easily with these files. To get a build running, just do this:

    go to FluidTracker in your terminal or CommandPrompt
    type in 'npm start' and click enter
    
A build should run in your default browser that you can then use to test the project.

We probably should be using this project now just for sake of ease, but it's up to you guys whether or not you want to switch repositories
